# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Buzz2Remote API to protect against common web application vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation

The API implements comprehensive input validation to prevent various types of attacks:

#### SQL Injection Protection
- Validates all user inputs against SQL injection patterns
- Uses parameterized queries with MongoDB
- Blocks common SQL injection attempts

#### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protection
- Validates and sanitizes all user inputs
- Removes dangerous HTML tags and attributes
- Blocks JavaScript and other script execution attempts

#### Path Traversal Protection
- Validates file paths and URLs
- Prevents directory traversal attacks
- Blocks attempts to access system files

#### Command Injection Protection
- Validates inputs for command injection patterns
- Blocks shell command execution attempts
- Sanitizes subprocess calls

### 2. Rate Limiting

The API implements multiple layers of rate limiting:

#### IP-based Rate Limiting
- Limits requests per IP address
- Configurable limits for different endpoints
- Automatic blocking of abusive IPs

#### User-based Rate Limiting
- Limits requests per authenticated user
- Higher limits for authenticated users
- Prevents user account abuse

#### Endpoint-specific Limits
- `/auth/login`: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- `/auth/register`: 3 registrations per hour
- `/auth/forgot-password`: 3 attempts per hour
- `/jobs/search`: 100 searches per hour
- `/admin/`: 10 requests per 5 minutes

### 3. Brute Force Protection

#### Login Protection
- Tracks failed login attempts per IP
- Blocks IP after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
- Clears failed attempts after successful login

#### Registration Protection
- Limits registration attempts per IP
- Validates email and password strength
- Prevents mass account creation

### 4. Authentication Security

#### Password Security
- Minimum 8 characters
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Password strength validation
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

#### JWT Security
- Secure token generation
- Configurable expiration times
- Environment variable-based secrets

#### Session Security
- Secure session management
- Environment variable-based session secrets
- Automatic session cleanup

### 5. Environment Security

#### Secret Management
- All secrets stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- `.env.example` file for configuration reference

#### Configuration Security
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure defaults for development
- Production-ready security settings

## Security Headers

The API includes the following security headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: CORS protection
- `Content-Type`: Proper content type specification
- `X-RateLimit-*`: Rate limiting information
- `Retry-After`: Rate limit retry information

## Input Validation Examples

### Email Validation
```python
# Valid emails
"user@example.com"
"user.name@domain.co.uk"
"user+tag@example.org"

# Invalid emails
"invalid-email"
"@example.com"
"user@"
```

### Password Strength
```python
# Strong passwords
"SecurePass123!"
"MyP@ssw0rd2024"
"Str0ng#Pass!"

# Weak passwords
"123"
"password"
"abc123"
```

### Input Sanitization
```python
# Before sanitization
"<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# After sanitization
"alert('xss')"
```

## Rate Limiting Examples

### IP-based Limits
- Default: 1000 requests per hour
- Auth endpoints: 5-10 requests per 5 minutes
- Admin endpoints: 10 requests per 5 minutes

### User-based Limits
- Authenticated users: 500 requests per hour
- Unauthenticated users: 100 requests per hour

## Brute Force Protection

### Login Attempts
1. First 4 failed attempts: 401 Unauthorized
2. 5th failed attempt: 429 Too Many Requests
3. IP blocked for 15 minutes
4. Successful login clears failed attempts

### Registration Attempts
1. Email validation
2. Password strength validation
3. Input sanitization
4. Rate limiting per IP

## Security Testing

Run security tests with:

```bash
# Run all security tests
pytest backend/tests/test_security.py -v

# Run specific test categories
pytest backend/tests/test_security.py::TestInputValidation -v
pytest backend/tests/test_security.py::TestRateLimiting -v
pytest backend/tests/test_security.py::TestAuthenticationSecurity -v
```
